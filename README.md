# Installation
 
## Step 0:
Download the PHP 7.4.x/8.0.x zip/rar version from the PHP Download site for Windows x86. Choose the x64 Thread Safe version if you have 64bit Windows. As of now PHP 8.0.1 is available so I have downloaded [PHP 7.4.x/8.0.x(Latest Version)](https://github.com/SIFORTECH-DEV/uwamp/blob/main/php8.0.9.zip).

## Step 1:
Locate to your WAMP directory, (usually {directory}/uwamp). Go to C:/wamp/bin/php and create a new folder “php8.0.9″ and extract the content of downloaded php .zip file here.

## Step 2:
Now, navigate to your old PHP folder. (mine is php7.1.10), and copy wampserver.conf from old and paste it to your “php8.0.9″ folder.

## Step 3:
Now, go to C:/wamp/bin/php/php8.0.9 folder and locate file php.ini-development. Copy it and rename to php.ini in the same directory.
