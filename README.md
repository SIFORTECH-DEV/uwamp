# Installation
 
## Step 0:
Download the PHP 7.4.x/8.0.x zip/rar version from the PHP Download site for Windows x86. Choose the x64 Thread Safe version if you have 64bit Windows. As of now PHP 8.0.1 is available so I have downloaded [PHP 7.4.x/8.0.x(Latest Version)](https://github.com/SIFORTECH-DEV/uwamp/blob/main/php8.0.9.zip).

## Step 1:
Copy to your UWAMP directory, (Eg. c://uwamp/). Go to C:/uwamp/bin/php and create a new folder “php8.0.9″ (if folder not exist)and extract the content of downloaded php .zip file here.

## Step 2:
Done.
